# Cpp_DSA_programs

##This repo contains solutions DSA(Data Structures and Algorithms) questions solved in C++.
###The questions are taken from GeeksForGeeks and LeetCode
###The links to the questions and a short summary is provided as a comment at the top of each question. The questions and their respective solutions have been seperated into easy, medium and hard category. You might find multiple answers to some questions. The first answer is done using the first approach that came to my mind, like a brute force approach. Better approaches, i.e with better time and space complexity, mostly using a different algorithm are also included to some questions. I added these solutions after stumbling upon similar solutions on the web.
###All solutions have been tried out using a test case.
